            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Soldier and Curtezan, in my opinion are ſo very like, that it would be accompany'd with impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to venture to decide which Profeſſion ought moſt to be avoided. The Curtezan vends her Beauty, and Merchandizes, the gifts of Heaven and Nature, with the vileſt Uſury. For he that is poor, muſt not think to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into her Converſation, whoſe heart is always Mercenary: The Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ſubmits his Life and Liberty for a few pence and a little painful Pay. If
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97520:104"/>
this is wanting, he either licenciouſly Mutinies, or runs a Rebel to thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where he thinks Rewards and Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends are more frequent and juſt. Hope is the Soul that gives Motion to both theſe Bodies. One is not better diſpos'd to Aſſaults, Battels, or Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Enemies, than through hopes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97520:104"/>
ſeems to differ from the Soldier in this, that her Practice being to promote the delights of the Senſes, ſhe cannot well be ſaid to act with force or violence. Nevertheleſs, conſidering the World has long ſince beſtow'd on Soldiers the glorious Epithets of <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Magnanimous,</hi> and on the contrary on Whores, thoſe of <hi>Vile</hi> and <hi>Infamous</hi> I conclude, that a Soldier ought to be more eſteem'd of in a civil Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, than a looſe and idle Curtezan. Thus much I have been able to write, to obey, not contend, with your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limer Genius; and I would humbly intreat your ſingular goodneſs, not to refuſe your Anſwer to the inclos'd Queſtion I have ſent you, whereby you may acquire perpetual Fame; whilſt I, confeſſing my ſelf all along an Admirer of your wondrous Abilities, conclude, Yours oblig'd without pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make any tolerable return, but which will nevertheleſs be always the earneſt endeavour of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>I Would willingly comply with your deſires, to anſwer the enclos'd; but being to diſcourſe of Political Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which require ſo acute a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to conceive the occult reaſons of the Statiſts, I know not whether I ſhall be able to write any thing to the purpoſe, it being rather a ſupernatural than ordinary Undertaking to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſound and unalterable Maxims of Government, for their great variety of circumſtances incline 'em the more to mutability. But ſince you have oblig'd me to it, I muſt obey and tell you that in my opinion the ruin of Republicks arriſes either from Wars, or a greater Force; ſuch as Earthquakes, Whirlpools, Fire, Thunder, Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Plagues, or the like. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97520:105"/>
a Republick ſhould find it ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to any one of theſe ſad Accidents, and the miſerable Citizens conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forc'd to chuſe new Members; you require of me whether their number ought barely to be equal to the old; tho' there ſhould not be enough to act in the ſeveral Courts of Juſtice, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publick Stations; or whether they have power to augment themſelves to a number neceſſary for the Defence of their Lives, Laws, and Liberties? For anſwer therefore I ſay, that Rulers being to have no other end in their Actions, than Juſtice, and the publick ſafety of their Subjects, they ought not to take greater care of themſelves: For dominion over others was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, that he who was poſſeſt of it ſhould only have regard to his own Honour or Intereſt, but the ſafety and defence of his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> gave this definition of a Republick, <hi>Reſpublica eſt quoddam Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus compaginatum ex membris, quod

An Houſe forſaken by its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters, quickly falls to ruin; a Ship de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of its Pilot is ſoon loſt.</p>
            <p>Now, Laſtly, if the number of the new Citizens ought to be greater or leſſer than the old; I ſay, that having regard to the publick neceſſity of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring Juſtice, they ought to be ſuitable to the occaſion: But to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the many diſorders that may happen through Emulation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which often have pernicious conſequences: I ſhould think it more conſonant to publick Good, that the numbers of 'em ſhould be equal, whilſt

it is not to be doubted, but that will keep an union in their minds, beget mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Affection, nouriſh Peace, and is indeed, the very Soul which maintains and preſerves a civil Body.

When this Fellow came firſt to live with me he promiſed mighty matters; endeavouring to perſwade me he was qualified with all the Sciences; and that he poſſeſt many other Arts; which made me the eaſier condeſcend to receive him into my Houſe; tho' muſt confeſs he was but a ſhabby Fellow: Yet the conſideration of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Univerſally obey'd by one Man, made me diſpence with all other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97520:111"/>
He was extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and peaceable for one Month, that I could not deſire better. But becauſe every right ſide has its wrong, at length, having a mind to give me farther proofs of his Excellencies; he began to play the part of a Phyſician, and feel the pulſe of my Bottles; and becauſe the ſweet Liquor might not create choler, he took care to let 'em often Blood. Alſo he made uſe of Spring Water to qualifie the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heat: From thence he went into the Granary, where he alſo behav'd himſelf like a very skilful Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, dividing and parting the Corn into many Figures. And becauſe that he had often ſcruples about the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; he was very diligent to make frequent tryals at the Market, and ſo, in ſhort, ſoon empty'd my Granary.
